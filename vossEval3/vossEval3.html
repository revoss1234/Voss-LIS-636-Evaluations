            <p1>For the third evaluation assignment I chose to review the <a href="https://statelibrary.ncdcr.gov/" target="_blank">State of North Carolina Library website</a>. I evaluated the website based on the Garretts's 5 Planes of User Experience Design. Those 5 plains are:
            <ul>
              <li>The Surface Plane</li>
              <li>The Skeleton Plane</li>
              <li>The Structure Plane</li>
              <li>The Scope Plane</li>
              <li>The Strategy Plane</li>

            </ul></p>

            <h3 class="paragraphtitle" id="surfaceplan">The Surface Plane</h3>
            <p>Garrett's first plane of user exsperince is the Surface Plane.  I feel this is looking at a website on the most basic level.  You are looking at the images and text found on the site and how they are used.  When looking at the State of North Carolina Library website the fist thing I notice is that
              there are not that many images on the homepage.  At the top of the page is a set of images that are scrolling and each image acts like a link to a resouce found on the website.  As you continue to scroll down the page each image you see are links to other parts of the website.  I find this very
              helpful when trying to search through the website.  There is very little text on the homescreen.  That makes it easy to navigate since there isn't a lot of useless words.  At the top are tabs that also allow you to find what you are looking for easily.  On the surface this site is basic looking
              which in turns makes it easy to use.<p>
            <h3 class="paragraphtitle" id="skeletonplane">The Skeleton Plane</h3>
            <p>The second plane is the Skeleton Plane.  This looks at what is under the surface.  It is looking at why and where things are placed.  At first glance the website placed a search bar at the top.  I found this very helpful.  I know that I am always looking for a search capability in websites and this site
              makes it easy.  Right under that are tabs to help patrons naviagte the website.  The tabs include a lot of information about the library. They are easy to find and use.  I like how all images are links to other resources.  This makes the site very streamline and efficient for patrons.<p>
            <h3 class="paragraphtitle" id="structureplane">The Structure Plane</h3>
            <p>The Structure Plane is the third plane of user experince.  This looks at how the information flows from one page to another.  I am going to focus on the tabs at the top and how they are structured.  The first tab has links to the three main services offered at the library.  The first service is for
              librarians and libraries.  Inside that tab are links and resources that librarians and libraries both can use.  The second service is the Government and Heritage Library.  This is filled with information and the catalog search for that part of the library.  The last service is for the Library for the Blind
              and Physically Handicapped.  It is set up a lot like the government service page.  After the service tab comes the Catalog search tab.  Then you are left with basic information tabs like events, blogs, job offerings, and contacts.  I feel this structure flows good.<p>
            <h3 class="paragraphtitle" id="scopeplane">The Scope Plane</h3>
            <p>Garrett's forth plane is the Scope Plane.  The Scope Plane looks at the functions of the website and how the fit in the site objective.  The goal of the State of North Carolina Library website is to get patrons interacting with the library.  The site has function like upcoming events listed to get patrons
              inside the doors of the library.  They also allow you to search the catalog for resources before you come so you know exactly what you will be looking for so it makes it easy to visit and use the library resources.  They also have times the library is open so you know when you can and can not visit
              library.  All these fuctions help with the objective of the website.<p>
            <h3 class="paragraphtitle" id="strategyplane">The Strategy Plane</h3>
            <p>The last plane of user exsperince is the Strategy Plane.  This is the plane that all sites are built on.  This plane looks at what the site objective is.  The main goal of this website is to get patrons involed with the state library.  You can see that through all the links and resources that the website
              wants you to be involed with the library.  They want you to come visit and use the resources provided at the library.
