            <p>For the first evaluation assignment I had to review the <a href="https://nwrlibrary.org/walnutcove/" target="_blank">Walnut Cove Public Library</a>. I evaluated the website based on three questions. Those three questions were:
            <ul>
              <li>What are the components of the website?</li>
              <li>	What tasks do you think the website was created to facilitate?</li>
              <li>	Do the components of the site make completing those tasks easy for users? Why?</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>The Walnut Cove Public Library website is a tool that patrons can use to find out information about the local library.  At first glance you see that this website is housed inside a larger website called nwrlibrary.org.  That is the website for the Northwest Regional Libraries.  All the libraries in that region are found here.  You can find basic information like location and time open to what services are offered at the library.  As you scroll down you also can meet the librarians and see pictures of things going on in the library.  It is a very basic site. </p>
            <p>So for the task of finding basic information about the Walnut Cove Public Library this site does a good job.  Easy to read and no clicking of things to find that information because it is all on the home screen. (See the screenshot below)  Other than basic information this site has really no other purpose than that.  You can search for books in the library but that is through the bigger nwrlibrary.org website.  To do that you have to back out of the Walnut Cove Library site and go back to the main page.</p>
            <p>This site is very basic. It is not overloaded with many images. You don’t have to do a lot of endless scrolling on pages to find information.  The thing I notice though is that it is missing information.  The calendar is blank with no events filled in.  I am not sure if that means nothing is going on or if they are behind in filling it out.  As a patron I would love knowing what events are being held here so I hope they do update it.  The second thing that is blank I noticed was the “What’s Happening” section.  Again I am not sure if they are behind or if they never have information there but I think this would be a great section to have updated to get patrons into the library.  To get them excited about what is going on.  I would suggest fillings these two sections out in order to maybe boost usage in the library.<p>
