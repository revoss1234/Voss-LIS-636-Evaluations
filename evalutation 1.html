            <p>For the first evaluation assignment I had to review the <a href="http://library.uncg.edu" target="_blank">UNCG Library Website</a>. I evaluated the website based on three questions. Those three questions were:
            <ul>
              <li>What are the components of the website?</li>
              <li>	What tasks do you think the website was created to facilitate?</li>
              <li>	Do the components of the site make completing those tasks easy for users? Why?</li>
            </ul></p>

            <h2 class="sectiontitle" id="essay">Eassy</h2>
            <p>The UNCG Library website is a great tool to use for the students and facility of UNCG.  After looking at the website and clicking on the different links I feel that the website has two main components.  The first component is giving you information about the library.  Basic information like location and time open to what services are offered at the library.  The second component is giving you a way to look up what resources are found in the library.</p>
            <p>These two tasks of searching for information and resources are easily accomplished because of the simplistic approach to the website.  The title links at the top of the site make it easy to navigate the site.  If someone is only on the site to search resources found in the library it is very easy to find.  You do not have to click on any links; the search box is at the top of the home screen of the webpage.  All you have to do is type in author, title or key words to find what you are looking for.</p>
            <p>This site is very user friendly.  It is not overloaded with many images.  You donâ€™t have to do a lot of endless scrolling on pages to find information.  It is all linked very nicely.  I feel that the UNCG Library does a great job making the site easy for patrons to use and navigate.  I would suggest when doing research to first see what the UNCG Library offers in the way of resources due to ease of using the website.<p>

<!--Zack Good creative use of website structure to fit asignment guidelines. I really liked the summary would like a little bit better cleaning up the code if you're going to copy it. Some of the tags don't make sense. -->
