            <p1>For the Fourth evaluation assignment I chose to review the <a href="https://www.forsyth.cc/library/default.aspx" target="_blank">Forysth County Library website</a>. I evaluated the website based on the Aesthetic Usability Effect Law of UX. My evaluation contains:
            <ul>
              <li>An overview of the site and the specific feature I reviewed</li>
              <li>A review of the law</li>
              <li>An analysis of the feature using the law</li>
              <li>Any recommendations for the site</li>


            </ul></p>

            <h3 class="paragraphtitle" id="surfaceplan">The Essay</h3>
            <p>For Evaluation 4 I have picked the Forsyth County Library System website.  This site is used to connect patrons with all the libraries in the Forsyth County Library System.  It provides a lot of information about libraries and what events are going on in the county.
              The feature I am going to be looking at is the aesthetics of the site.  The site at first glance is very basic.  Not a lot of color or animation.  It does not catch the eye of me as a user.  This site is very link heavy.  With the amount of information this site has to
              provide it has to have a lot of links or it would take a lot of scrolling.  Along the top is a links bar with lots of different links and then on the side are link buttons that overlap with some of the links at the top.  The “kids” link is the only one that has some animation and images that are eye catching.
              I will be looking at the Law of UX entitled Aesthetic Usability Effect to evaluate this site.<p>

	          <p>The Aesthetic Usability Effect Law states that the “User often perceives aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.”  This law came about through a study in 1995 showing that participates were, “strongly influenced by the aesthetics of any given interface, even when they try to evaluate the underlying functionality of the system.” (Moran, 2017)
              Some of the major aesthetic factors that affect users are color combination, visual layout, and text font.  This law states that these factors really play into the idea that users will have a positive attitude toward the site.  Even if the site isn’t that easy to navigate this law says user will look past that because of the aesthetic of the site.
              In an article found on Medium.com it states that, “Aesthetic designs, in general, look easier to use and have a higher probability of being used, whether or not they actually are easier to use.” (Chakraborty, 2017)  Overall people want a site that looks good and if it does then they are more likely to use it.<P>

	          <p>I see the Law of Aesthetic Usability Effect in action when I look at the Forsyth County Library System website.  It has a very basic design with simple colors, fonts, and graphics.  When I look at the site I am not very impressed with it so in turn I feel like it isn’t a site I would like to use.
              It makes me feel like it is hard to use even if it isn’t.  The first thing I thought was that there were way to many links but when I look at it through the eye of the UX law I feel that maybe I think that because of the design of the site.  If the site was more eye catching I would be interested in seeing if my way of thinking would change.
              That is where a usability test might come into play for the library.  <p>

            <p>I would recommend that this site work on its design.  I would add some more color other than white and even add some animations or moving graphics.  This would maybe make the site better for the users.  If I worked for the Forsyth County Library System I would do some site testing with patrons to see if making changes to the aesthetics would affect the user experience.
              It would be interesting to see.<p>
